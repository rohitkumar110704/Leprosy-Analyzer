# Leprosy-Analyzer
 The Leprosy Analyzer is a Python-based project designed to assist medical professionals in the analysis and detection of leprosy, a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. This project leverages the power of computer vision and image processing techniques to aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of leprosy.
